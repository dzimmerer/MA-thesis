\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

In 2012 by winning the Imagenet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 convolutional neural network gained a big rise in popularity. 
Now they are becoming popular for their powerful abstraction mechanism in the fields of image and video classification and description and speech recognition. 
This can be contributed to compositional structure in which the world can be perceived and to their ability to extract high level features on spatial and/or temporal conditioned data.

Generating discriminative high level features extractors allows the system to dynamically adapt to the input data and work on various kinds of data. 
In addition the features extractors do not need to have any semantic representation and can be more complex to the manually build feature extractors. 
This also removes the labor-intensive and time consuming task of manually building feature extractors.
Consequently they recently got adapted to solve robotic problems like grasp planning, drone navigation and autonomous driving. 

One precursor of those are the deep belief networks (DBNs), which are built up of restricted boltzmann machines (RBMs). 
DBNs have shown excellent performance on image classification tasks in the early 2000s.

Compared to classical CNNs, DBNs allow recurrent connections and are trained in an unsupervised manner and do not need labeled data. 
They have been described as  “probably the most biologically plausible learning algorithm for deep architectures we currently know”. 
DBNs can be used as generative model as well, which means they can sample data according to a learned distribution, e.g. find the most probable completion for a partially erased image.

Adding convolution to DBNs increased the performance of DBNs on image classification tasks, caught up to state of the art results and made the system more similar to the primate visual cortex than a standard RBM. 

All those approaches use scalar values between neurons at discrete time slices to propagate information. 
This proposes some difficulties and is not biologically plausible, since biological neuron interleave linear and nonlinear operations, they communicate by stochastic binary values and are not synchronized. 
Spiking neural networks (SNNs), designed to simulate the communication between neurons with action potentials/ spikes, work in continuous time by design and do not suffer from the aforementioned limitations.

\section{Problem Statement}

To our best knowledge, up to today, there exists no system which utilizes the benefits of all those approaches. 
The main objective of this thesis is to realize such a spiking network, which integrates convolution and can be easily trained utilizing the RBM learning algorithm, to extract high level features. 
Two approaches are described. 
The first approach trains convolutional RBMs on discretized input data, to build up a DBN which is then converted to a SNN. 
The next approach directly works on continuous (event-driven) input-data and realizes a STDP learning algorithm with shared weights to train spiking convolutinal RBMs directly. 
Both approaches will learn to extract high level features, which can be further used to classify an object or directly generate a grasp id. 

\section{The Human Brain Project}

Heiko:

This thesis is under the scope of the research of the SP10 (sub-project 10) of the Human Brain
Project. The Human Brain Project is an European Commission Future and Emerging Technologies Flagship and a large ten-year research project which aims to create a collaborative research infrastructure across national borders to progress the knowledge in neuroscience, computational neuroscience, medicine, scientific computation, and robotics. In the project over 120
institution from across Europe collaborate in 12 sub-projects.

The sub-project 10 of the Human Brain Project develops the Neurorobotics Platform which
permits researchers to simulate robotic experiments with regard to neurorobotics. Apart from the
platform, research is focused on the development of applications in robotics based on insights
from neuroscience. One focus of the research group at the FZI Karlsruhe is the development of
computational models for neurobiological inspired robotic grasping.

Chapter 2 introduces sine background information, which is used in chapter 3 to describe state-of-the-art research used in this thesis. Chapter 4 will describe the different approaches to build such a spiking convolutional deep belief networks. In chapter 5 the different implementation steps and the architecture will be described. Chapter 6 outlines and compares the performance of the networks. Chatper 7 will conclude the gathered insight of this thesis, state its limitations and give suggestions for further improvements and research.
